D 335: Introduction to Programming in Python 

Date class was taken: (March 1st, 2023 - May 6th, 2023)

Posted herein is a copy of my coding questions and answers given on the D335 Python Pre-Assessment test for a 15 out of 15 Pass!

NOTE: The actual proctored exam was very similar to the Pre-Assessment in so far as testing my knowledge of how to solve similar problems from scratch.
