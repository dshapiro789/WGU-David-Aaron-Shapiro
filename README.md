D 335: Introduction to Programming in Python 

Date class was taken: (March 1st, 2023 - May 6th, 2023)

The following coursework represents my hands-on coding experience not only learning how to program in Python, 
but also applying the language to solve a wide variety of problems.

Posted herein is a copy of my coding answers given on the Pre-Assessment test for a 15 out of 15 Pass!

The actual exam was very similar to the Pre-Assessment in so far as testing my knowledge of how to solve similar problems.
