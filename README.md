D286: Java Foundations

Date class was taken: (December 1st, 2023 - December 23rd, 2023)

The following coursework represents my hands-on coding experience not only learning how to program in Java, but also applying the language to solve a variety of unique problems.

Posted herein is a copy of my coding questions and answers given on the Java Pre-Assessment test for a 14 out of 14 Pass!

The actual proctored exam was very similar to the Pre-Assessment in so far as testing my knowledge of how to solve similar problems.
